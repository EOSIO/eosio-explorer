# Transaction List Page

The transaction list page contains a list of transactions performed on the blockchain, up to a maximum of the latest **100** transactions. It is also possible to search for a particular transaction or check the details of one shown on this list.

Optionally, you can decide to change the number of transactions to display on the page to 10, 20 or 50 transactions at the bottom of this page.

## Transaction List

The transaction list panel contains a table of transactions performed on the blockchain. Each row in the table contains the following information:
* Transaction ID
* Block number (the block where this transaction was executed)
* Timestamp

Clicking on a row will take you to its associated [Transaction Detail Page](./detail-pages/transaction-detail-page.md). 

### Transaction Search

On the upper right corner of this panel is a search box where you can look for a particular transaction based on its ID. You can paste the transaction ID into the search input field and click "Search." If the transaction exists, you will be sent to its associated [Transaction Detail Page](./detail-pages/transaction-detail-page.md) otherwise you will be shown a page saying that the transaction does not exist.

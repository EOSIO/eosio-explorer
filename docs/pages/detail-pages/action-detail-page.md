# Action Detail Page

The action detail page contains more information about a single action performed on the blockchain. An action type belongs to a single smart contract and is performed as part of a transaction. A transaction can contain multiple actions, but the action detail page will only show information about a specific one selected from the [Action List Page](../action-list-page.md).

## Action Detail

The action detail panel contains the basic information about a particular action. The panel will display the following fields:
* Smart contract name
* Action type
* Timestamp
* Transaction ID (clickable link to the corresponding [Transaction Detail Page](transaction-detail-page.md))
* Actor 

The actor is the account which signed the action.

## Action Raw JSON

A panel containing a visualization of the raw JSON data of the action.

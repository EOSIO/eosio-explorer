# Managing Connections

:warning: Disclaimer :warning:

As this tool is meant for local development, you should try as much as possible to use this Connections panel when working with remote blockchains other than the local one which this tool starts for you. You should also use this panel if you are starting this tool with the `start_gui` command.

Possible Actions:

* [Making a New Connection](new-connections.md)
* [Resetting the Current Connection](reset-connections.md)

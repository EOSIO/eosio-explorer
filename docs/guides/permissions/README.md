# Managing Accounts

:warning: Disclaimer :warning:

You won't see any panels in this page if you are currently not connected to any blockchain. 

This means you don't have any access to the actions in this page. Make sure you're connected to a blockchain (`nodeos` instance) first.

Possible Actions:

* [Creating a new Account](create_account.md)
* [Importing Private Keys to an Existing Account](import_account.md)
* [Updating the Public and Private Keys of an Existing Account](update_account.md)
* Reset all Permissions - Click the button labeled "Reset all Permissions" to reset the list of accounts to its initial state. 

:zap: - If you are connected to a `nodeos` instance created using this tool, you will see the default `eosio` system contracts account that ships with that blockchain. Otherwise, you will not see any accounts that are selectable for use. **You will also lose all private keys kept in your local storage** so please back them up before doing this!

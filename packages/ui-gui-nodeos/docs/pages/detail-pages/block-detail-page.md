# Block Detail Page

The block detail page contains more information about a specific block. You will see this page either by searching for a produced block that exists or by clicking its entry in the block list page. 

## Block Detail

The Block Detail panel contains the basic information on the specific block. The fields here are exactly the same as in the Block List Page, showing the following:
* Block number
* Block ID
* Timestamp
* Number of transactions

## Transaction List

If the block is not empty, then this panel will be visible, containing a table of the list of transactions associated with this block. Each row consists of the following information:
* Index
* Transaction ID

Clicking on a particular row will take you to the associated [Transaction Detail Page](transaction-detail-page.md) of that particular transaction.

## Block Raw JSON

A panel containing a visualization of the raw JSON data of the produced block. This is taken directly from the currently connected MongoDB service.
